# Retail Cohort Analysis Project

This project performs cohort analysis on a retail dataset using MySQL, where we explore cohort-based metrics such as order counts, customer counts, and revenue by cohorts, and visualize insights in Power BI.

## Project Outline

1. **Load and Structure Data**: Load data into MySQL and structure it for cohort analysis.
2. **Cohort Creation**: Group customers by their first purchase month.
3. **Cohort Metric Calculation**: Create views to calculate key metrics:
   - **Invoice Count by Cohort**
